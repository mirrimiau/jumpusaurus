A quick look into making a randomly created 2D terrain for a proof-of-concept game. The change in slope is coded to start small
and grow as the map moves from left to right. This would simulate a "rising difficulty" for the mover in the map if the aim was
to advance as far as possible in the game. So basically smooth slopes at first, then bigger and bigger mountains and valleys.
